Select random winners from a list of participants.

Once the Raffle is closed, assign a number to each participant. You can enter the total amount of participants and drop those that do not participate from the list.
Then run the python file and voil√†, the script will select random winners between the qualified participants.

You can modify the script to enter a list of names, and run the program to select random winners displaying their names.

Cheers!
