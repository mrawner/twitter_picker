Select random winners for a Twitter giveaway

Once the Twitter giveaway (or airdrop) is closed, assign a number to each participant.
Then run the python file and voil√†, the script will select random winners between the participants.

You can modify the script to enter a list of names, and run the program to select random winners displaying their names.

Cheers!
